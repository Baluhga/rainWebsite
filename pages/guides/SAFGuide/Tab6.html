    <h2>General information</h2>
    <p>Musous are certain monsters in the endgame of Frontier which are famously hard to beat. Some of these Musou matchups are harder than others, but it is fair to say that most of them require a lot of practice to get consistent clears. Aside from practice and a good playstyle what you will also need (and with this document receive) are <strong>good builds</strong> for every individual Musou matchup. These will be divided into general sets which are the easiest option for every Musou and a specific speedrun optimized set that can be used if you are seeking to optimize your clear time (to get the Speedrunner title using Switch Axe and/or compete with other speedrunners).</p>
    
    <p>This section will also include two non-musou matchups which might as well be Musou matchups given their difficulty level, namely: <strong>Upper Shiten Disufiroa</strong> and <strong>Upper Shiten Unknown</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>It is important to note that the sets mentioned in here are both optimized for killing and comfort, if you want to maximize DPS and speedrun we suggest the sets from the speedrunning section!</strong></p>

<!-- Fairly Easy Matchup Section -->
<section id="fairly-easy">
    <h3>Fairly easy matchup:</h3>
    
    <h4>Thirsty Pariapuria (Paria)</h4>
    <p>Very easy matchup mainly because he barely has any health and very good hitzones on top of that. Some of his attacks have wack hitboxes but that is given how outdated the fight is. His stone rain can sometimes be a bit annoying to parry (similar to narga rain) but most of his attacks have obvious tells and can be avoided even with CS.</p>
    
    <h4>Bombardier Bogabadorumu (Boga)</h4>
    <p>Similar to his Zenith version but has double explosions on all of his explosion attacks, 1.2 Million EHP and is slightly faster. Still not really that big of a deal, you can get very comfortable in the fight even with CS. Main "hard" moves are his slide when learning the fight and his double explosion trail. After the arm break the fight becomes very easy.</p>
    
    <h4>Howling Zinogre (Zino)</h4>
    <p>Pure parry matchup. ~500k EHP (relatively low). His moveset is perhaps a bit annoying to learn at first but once you get the hang of it it's usually enough to kill him consistently. Fight time gets lower the more you learn to PD. The most dangerous moves are his spin and his quick uppercut after rocks. It is recommended to learn the fight off the wall because he will dash around less but you can also fight him at the wall for more comfort.</p>
</section>

<!-- Takes a Bit to Learn Section -->
<section id="bit-to-learn">
    <h3>Takes a bit to learn but manageable:</h3>
    
    <h4>Mysterious Mi Ru</h4>
    <p>He has 375k EHP and is quite a fun matchup once you get to learn his moveset. Some of his hitboxes linger a very long time (like the one of his spins). Getting used to fire trails he sets out (and where they land) will also help in this matchup.</p>
    
    <h4>Ruler Guanzorumu (Guan)</h4>
    <p>With 200k EHP the lowest HP out of all Musous. I wouldn't really call this fight a Musou either, the fight mechanics are quite annoying to get used to but you may accidentally kill him without realizing. With CS the wind-pressure into tornadoes is the biggest run killer, together with his double arm slam and his nuke. Other than that all his moves are fairly easy to punish.</p>
    
    <h4>Upper Shiten Unknown (Unknown)</h4>
    <p>You can ignore HP numbers in the first phase of the fight (it's actually 6 separate phases but let's summarize them) since you can script the entirety of this phase. Her moves are super awkward, hitboxes are not aligned correctly and also really dumb and since she has Gen 1 rathian AI she has some of the dumbest 1 frame attack windups ever. Second phase attacks to look out for are mainly ones that wind-pressure you (fireballs etc.) and the wingflap, the sidehop into instant fireball and her run if you're too far. She only has 300k EHP in her last phase so she dies quickly.</p>
    
    <h4>Sparkling Zerureusu (Zeru)</h4>
    <p>Fairly decent to learn matchup but can be punishing if you're not careful. He has 750k EHP and does his intro attack at the start, at 50% and at 10% HP. The main thing that's gonna annoy you in this fight is his bite, his wind-pressure and hipcheck (which all he can do while you're hitlagged by an attack). Every other move can be avoided with good timing. Very good fight to learn CS on.</p>
</section>

<!-- Hard Matchup Section -->
<section id="hard">
    <h3>Hard matchup:</h3>
    
    <h4>Blinking Nargacuga (Narga)</h4>
    <p>Narga is a relatively hard to learn matchup, although with 600k EHP you shouldn't have trouble killing him when you learn the fight the consistency is still a bit iffy on this fight. Main difficulty comes from his hitboxes being very sensitive to positioning (with CS it's way harder to reposition) and his rain attack needs to be parried when learning the fight with CS which needs good timing and fast fingers.</p>
</section>

<!-- Extremely Hard Matchup Section -->
<section id="extremely-hard">
    <h3>Extremely hard matchup:</h3>
    
    <h4>Upper Shiten Disufiroa (Disu)</h4>
    <p>Awful fight doesn't even begin to describe it. Disu has 750k EHP but loses HP during the first phase transition. The fight consists of gauge management issues, the worst hitboxes the game has ever seen, mindnumbingly low attack frequency and hit rate (making it hard to even stack Stylish Assault) and on top of that size variation which make his best hitzone only consistently reachable if he's at least medium size small. I cannot think of a good reason to grind this fight other than for speedrunner but if you want to there are example runs on rain.</p>
    
    <h4>Arrogant Duremudira (Durem or Dure)</h4>
    <p>Very fun but also a ridiculously hard matchup on Swaxe, especially with CS. He also has 750k EHP and is inside a road quest meaning no diva skill and no starving wolf with adrenaline (unless you want to wait for 40 minutes). Very hard to learn since it's hard to tell apart all the windup to his attacks when first fighting him. You mostly stay at his tail when fighting him. Main difficult moves are especially the paw slam, the tail spin and his laser dash if you're in a bad spot.</p>
    
    <h4>Starving Deviljhos (Jhos)</h4>
    <p>Nightmare quest with Swaxe. Stand at a wall, parry and hope for the best. Each of them have 200k EHP and good thunder hitzones, but constantly stack attacks on top of each other which makes a hitless run nearly impossible to get. The really annoying attacks are their pin attacks, foot stomps hitting behind you and the hipcheck having little to no windup. Really only do this quest if you need to.</p>
</section>

<!-- Hardest Matchup Section -->
<section id="hardest">
    <h3>Hardest matchup in the game:</h3>
    
    <h4>Burning Freezing Elzelion (Elz)</h4>
    <p><strong>None of the monsters so far mentioned come even close to how hard this fight is.</strong> He has 1 Million EHP, a myriad of attacks that are very hard to deal with, very little recovery between attacks, awful tail hitbox and since the giant HP pool forces you to play as aggressive as possible he will do everything he can to do his running attack into ur hitlag. The most annoying mechanic of the fight is his nuke, wasting ~12 seconds every time he does it. This is the epitome of difficulty in this game, <u>I'd recommend doing him last after doing every other Musou.</u></p>

<!-- Builds Section -->
<section id="builds">
    <h2>Builds against Musous/Shitens</h2>
    <p>Builds for matchups will be ordered according to the tier list difficulty. The sets presented in this section combine both effectiveness but also comfort for the matchup, meaning that the intended purpose of the set is to kill the monster as painlessly as possible. In the speedrunning section there will be additional builds for people that seek to highly optimize their damage and sacrifice all comfort in the matchup. <strong>If you want to know why certain skills are listed here, check out the In Depth Info section.</strong></p>
    
    <p>It is worth to note that <strong><u>every monster in the game can be killed with Despair Frostaxe "Flash"</u></strong>, so if you don't have the suggested Swaxe and don't feel like grinding it, you can always use Despair Frostaxe "Flash" and it works perfectly fine.</p>

    <p>
        Thirsty Paria has really low HP, most people don't consider him an endgame fight in zenith gear so this set
        should get you covered if you're just going for a kill. For ele matching, go <strong>Black Charaxt</strong> since he's weak to fire
        but Frostaxe will be more than good enough anyway.

<section id="bombardier-bogabadorumu">
    <h2>Bombardier Bogabadorumu</h2>
    <img src="images/image403.png" alt="Bombardier Bogabadorumu" class="full-width-img">
    
    <h3>"Cheap" Build</h3>
    <p>
        Boga is a special matchup because of his high poison uptime and the fact that poison attacks his True HP (30k) instead of 
        the EHP (1.2 Million) meaning it is a very effective weapon to kill him even <em>without using an Evo!</em> The poison Swaxe in question would be the <strong>Tower Swaxe</strong> with the following upgrades:
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Element:</strong> Invest 4 points and use the Ice Ele Sigil</p>
    <p><strong>Status:</strong> Invest until it says max and use the Poison Sigil</p>
    <p><strong>Sharpness:</strong> Invest 1 point</p>
    <p><strong>Attack:</strong> Use all the points that you have left</p>
    <p><strong>Additionally:</strong> Use a Skill Slots Up+1 Sigil to get the Z Skill on the weapon</p>
    
    <p>
        The Tower Swaxe is very good because it needs almost no RDP to max it. Alternatively you can also use the <strong>Halloween Swaxe</strong> (Status Phial, Poison) that performs similarly. Now onto the set:

    <h3>More Expensive Build</h3>
    <p>
        For Boga in most cases, the default CS+SW set works perfectly fine (ty Zaze for the set search). The matchup is especially interesting since it is one of the matchups where <strong>Despair Frostaxe "Shine" is straight up better than Despair Frostaxe "Flash" if you have a perfect Z Ele Sigil</strong>, which means Element phials rule in this fight. <em>The element version of this build will be talked about in the speedrunning section.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        A set that has Obscurity Up and Ice Age instead of Stylish+Up is worse but also works if it's purely for a kill.

        Quite an annoying matchup with Swaxe. His hitboxes are awful and parrying a lot of his attacks requires guard+2. Overall
        he still dies quite fast especially with endgame gear so he should bring no issue. Because of his varying ele res on different parts it's more
        comfortable to just go with <strong>Apophis Axe "Clear"</strong>, especially since a stun offers a good opportunity for a discharge.

        Here is where it gets interesting. I will present a non-CS version and a CS version, non-CS being 
        much easier to play in this matchup. You can choose whatever you prefer, just note that parrying the rain

        Yea, this fight sucks. Going in there with or without CS, I will guarantee you will lose your mind grinding this fight, but victory
        always tastes sweet right? Here you definitely want <strong>Black Flowaxt "Flash"</strong> since his legs have really good water hitzones

        Beautiful fight but also incredibly frustrating at the same time
        if you decide to grind it with CS. Although it is hard, the good
        thing is with a good setup you are usually not fighting against
        timeout like for Elz, but dying once basically seals the deal without
        Bonus Art and a good pace. Presented here are, similar to Narga,
        a non-CS and a CS version that you can choose from, the 
        CS version making the fight substantially harder but also giving 
        you a lot more damage. <strong>The CS version is basically your standard CS set from Boga/Zeru with different guild food.</strong>
    </p>
    
    <h3>Non-CS Version</h3>
    <p>Easiest here would be to use the standard reflect set similar to the one for Zinogre, just with innate Lone Wolf.</p>

        Now onto the star of the list, Musou Elz. Here you definitely
        want the standard non-CS reflect set at the start because CS
        is incredibly hard to make work (possible, but atp not worth).
        While it is possible to kill him with the Tower Swaxe, it will be a 
        very close run against timeout and generally a way worse grind
        than with <strong>Despair Frostaxe "Flash", so it's best to wait till 
        you have that Evo at <em>lvl 100</em> before attempting this fight.</strong>

    <p>While it is possible to run Shine in this quest (Mel has a video on his youtube) and it performs really well, it really benefits from the Z Sigil+Transcend uptime and grinding for this uptime is generally not fun. Additionally, his elemental hitzones are not good enough to make up for the damage loss on the sigil downtime. <em>This is the most <strong>consistent</strong> build for killing him</em>.</p>

    <h2>Special Quest: Musou Legion</h2>
    <p>Musou Legion is a special quest on the Rain server that consists of killing 5 Musous in succession with a time limit of 50 minutes. The order of the monsters is:</p>
    
<p class="full-width-img" style="display: flex; flex-wrap: nowrap; gap: 10px; align-items: flex-start;">
    <img src="images/image403.png" alt="Bogabadorumu" style="height: auto; max-width: 20%;">
    <img src="images/image409.png" alt="Zinogre" style="height: auto; max-width: 20%;">
    <img src="images/image406.png" alt="Elzelion" style="height: auto; max-width: 20%;">
    <img src="images/image4020.png" alt="Nargacuga" style="height: auto; max-width: 20%;">
    <img src="images/image4021.png" alt="Zerureusu" style="height: auto; max-width: 20%;">
</p>
<p><strong>Boga → Zino → Elz → Narga → Zeru</strong></p>    
    <p>This quest is quite tough even for someone having killed all of these monsters since you have to run most of it with adrenaline (you can drop adren after Elz if you're playing on <strong>Seph patch</strong> since it causes the Zeru at the end to die very quickly, dropping adren before is also possible but only if you play really well and don't get hit often). Obviously, <strong>Despair Frostaxe "Flash"</strong> is the best general option since most of these have really good or decent ice hitzones. What you want to run is a standard non-CS reflect set since otherwise Elz will be quite a bother (it's also much more comfortable to play on quest that's taking this long to be completed).</p>
