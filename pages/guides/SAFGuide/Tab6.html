    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c4">Musous are certain monsters in the endgame of Frontier which are famously hard to beat. Some of these Musou matchups are harder than others, but it is fair to say that most of them require a lot of practice to get consistent clears. Aside from practice and a good playstyle what you will also need (and with this document receive) are </span>
      <span class="c0">good builds</span>
      <span class="c1">&nbsp;for every individual Musou matchup. These will be divided into general sets which are the easiest option for every Musou and a specific speedrun optimized set that can be used if you are seeking to optimize your clear time (to get the Speedrunner title using Switch Axe and/or compete with other speedrunners).</span>

    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c18 c9 c4">Thirsty Pariapuria (Paria)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c4">Very easy matchup mainly because he barely has any health and very good hitzones on top of that. Some of his attacks have wack hitboxes but that is given how outdated the fight is. His stone rain can sometimes be a bit annoying to parry (similar to narga rain) but most of his attacks have obvious tells and can be avoided even with CS.</span>

      <span class="c9 c4">Bombardier Bogabadorumu (Boga)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c1">Similar to his Zenith version but has double explosions on all of his explosion attacks, 1.2 Million EHP and is slightly faster. Still not really that big of a deal, you can get very comfortable in the fight even with CS. Main &ldquo;hard&rdquo; moves are his slide when learning the fight and his double explosion trail. After the arm break the fight becomes very easy.</span>

    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c18 c9 c4">Howling Zinogre (Zino)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c1">Pure parry matchup. ~500k EHP (relatively low). His moveset is perhaps a bit annoying to learn at first but once you get the hang of it it&rsquo;s usually enough to kill him consistently. Fight time gets lower the more you learn to PD. The most dangerous moves are his spin and his quick uppercut after rocks. It is recommended to learn the fight off the wall because he will dash around less but you can also fight him at the wall for more comfort.</span>

      <span class="c18 c9 c4">Mysterious Mi Ru</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c4">He has 375k EHP and is quite a fun matchup once you get to learn his moveset. Some of his hitboxes linger a very long time (like the one of his spins). Getting used to fire trails he sets out (and where they land) will also help in this matchup. </span>

    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c9 c4">Ruler Guanzorumu (Guan)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c1">With 200k EHP the lowest HP out of all Musous. I wouldn&#39;t really call this fight a Musou either, the fight mechanics are quite annoying to get used to but you may accidentally kill him without realizing. With CS the wind-pressure into tornadoes is the biggest run killer, together with his double arm slam and his nuke. Other than that all his moves are fairly easy to punish.</span>

    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c9 c4">Upper Shiten Unknown (Unknown)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c1">You can ignore HP numbers in the first phase of the fight (it&rsquo;s actually 6 separate phases but let&rsquo;s summarize them) since you can script the entirety of this phase. Her moves are super awkward, hitboxes are not aligned correctly and also really dumb and since she has Gen 1 rathian AI she has some of the dumbest 1 frame attack windups ever. Second phase attacks to look out for are mainly ones that wind-pressure you (fireballs etc.) and the wingflap, the sidehop into instant fireball and her run if you&#39;re too far. She only has 300k EHP in her last phase so she dies quickly.</span>

      <span class="c4 c9">Sparkling Zerureusu (Zeru)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c1">Fairly decent to learn matchup but can be punishing if you&rsquo;re not careful. He has 750k EHP and does his intro attack at the start, at 50% and at 10% HP. The main thing that&rsquo;s gonna annoy you in this fight is his bite, his wind-pressure and hipcheck (which all he can do while you&rsquo;re hitlagged by an attack). Every other move can be avoided with good timing. Very good fight to learn CS on.</span>

      <span class="c3 c0"></span>

      <span class="c3 c0">Hard matchup:</span>

    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c18 c9 c4">Blinking Nargacuga (Narga)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c1">Narga is a relatively hard to learn matchup, although with 600k EHP you shouldn&rsquo;t have trouble killing him when you learn the fight the consistency is still a bit iffy on this fight. Main difficulty comes from his hitboxes being very sensitive to positioning (with CS it&rsquo;s way harder to reposition) and his rain attack needs to be parried when learning the fight with CS which needs good timing and fast fingers.</span>

    <p class="c2">
      <span class="c1"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c3 c0">Extremely hard matchup:</span>

    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c18 c9 c4">Upper Shiten Disufiroa (Disu)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c1">Awful fight doesn&rsquo;t even begin to describe it. Disu has 750k EHP but loses HP during the first phase transition. The fight consists of gauge management issues, the worst hitboxes the game has ever seen, mindnumbingly low attack frequency and hit rate (making it hard to even stack Stylish Assault) and on top of that size variation which make his best hitzone only consistently reachable if he&rsquo;s at least medium size small. I cannot think of a good reason to grind this fight other than for speedrunner but if you want to there are example runs on rain.</span>

      <span class="c9 c4">Arrogant Duremudira (Durem or Dure)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c1">Very fun but also a ridiculously hard matchup on Swaxe, especially with CS. He also has 750k EHP and is inside a road quest meaning no diva skill and no starving wolf with adrenaline (unless you want to wait for 40 minutes). Very hard to learn since it&rsquo;s hard to tell apart all the windup to his attacks when first fighting him. You mostly stay at his tail when fighting him. Main difficult moves are especially the paw slam, the tail spin and his laser dash if you&#39;re in a bad spot. </span>

      <span class="c9 c4">Starving Deviljhos (Jhos)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c5">
      <span class="c1">Nightmare quest with Swaxe. Stand at a wall, parry and hope for the best. Each of them have 200k EHP and good thunder hitzones, but constantly stack attacks on top of each other which makes a hitless run nearly impossible to get. The really annoying attacks are their pin attacks, foot stomps hitting behind you and the hipcheck having little to no windup. Really only do this quest if you need to.</span>

      <span class="c4">&nbsp;He has 1 Million EHP, a myriad of attacks that are very hard to deal with, very little recovery between attacks, awful tail hitbox and since the giant HP pool forces you to play as aggressive as possible he will do everything he can to do his running attack into ur hitlag. The most annoying mechanic of the fight is his nuke, wasting ~12 seconds every time he does it. This is the epitome of difficulty in this game, </span>
