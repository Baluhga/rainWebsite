<!-- Calculations Introduction Section -->

<h1>Calculations for Skills</h1>

<p>Feel free to entirely skip this section if you are not interested in in-depth calculations of skills/phials and general effectiveness of builds. This section will be a bit technical by default so if you don't understand much here, @ me in discord (mel177371) and I will happily answer all your questions, concerns and suggestions regarding this section.</p>

<p>The calculations I did in this section were done using the damage calc on <a href="https://wycademy.vercel.app/tools/calculator/damage">Doriels website</a>, which works absolute wonders for calculating every tick of damage you do to a monster in frontier. I highly suggest learning how to use it as it is one of the key worktools that allowed me to explore different meta options which were not considered in the past. The walkthrough on this website is a good way to get introduced to the tools on this site, try it out if you want.</p>

<p>Another important thing to note: I did most of these calculations by myself using models that I found appropriate while using sources for the various parameters. These calculations are not to be interpreted as the undoubted truth! I also make mistakes so if you think something may not be applicable as I have calculated it, please dm me and let's discuss it. I want to be as mathematically accurate as possible but it's hard to be completely unbiased when having to work with example cases.</p>

<p>Important information ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every monster has a certain true HP (THP) (often 30k but not always, exceptions are for example Musou Zinogre and Upper Shiten Disu), true HP divided by it's defense rate gives you the effective HP (EHP)</li>
<li>The calculations show damage numbers that will be done to the monsters THP, taking into account it's defense rate (so even though e.g. Narga and Elz have 30k THP, the damage numbers on a hitzone with the same numerical value will be different because the defense rate is different)</li>
<li>The reference monster, its hitzone and applied buffs/skills/weapon stats/sigils will be mentioned at the start of the given section or referenced</li>
<li>Alot of these calculations assume certain scenarios that I will mention beforehand, or reference in any existing Swaxe run</li>
<li>Often the term Hitzone value (or in short HZV) will be used in this section to refer to the hitzone that a monster has on a particular body part (i.e. the multiplier on the dealt physical/elemental damage on this monsters part)</li>
</ul>

<!-- Perfect Defense Section -->
<section id="perfect-defense">
<h2>Importance of Perfect Defense</h2>

<p>Perfect Defense (lg) is a caravan skill that you unlock by leveling your caravan gem to a certain point and it does the following:</p>

<p>If you input a guard/parry within 4 frames before a monster's attack hitbox connects, you will activate perfect defense (which we will call PD) which cancels knockback from the parry/guard and reflects damage back to the monster. The base mv of PD is 72 which is very high and gets raised to 92 if you run Reflect+3 and Reflect Up+1 in your set (which you usually do in matchups where you can PD). You can only pd if you have enough stamina for a roll (without including Taijutsu), which means if you use CS+SW you are not able to use PD. We will purely focus on the 2 primary cases where you are always able to PD (Zino and Elz). If you run Reflect+3 and Reflect Up+1, your parries (outside of the PD window) will also reflect back damage with a mv of 68, so PDing a move instead for 92 mv meaning 24 mv more on every pd compared to normal reflects, which I probably won't need to tell you is much better. PDing every attack instead of normal reflecting it means you have a total damage increase of ~24% for every reflect proc, which is something that you should absolutely get used to, especially when doing legion where you will most likely not be able to run CS.</p>

<!-- Z Sigil Math Section -->
<section id="z-sigil-math">
<h2>Z Sigil Math class</h2>

<p>By now you should have noticed how often I dropped the word Z Sigil in my builds. These are sigils in the Zenith category which you can roll for using Zenith monster parts. They can be directly used like items but without having to sheathe. They have both a duration and a cooldown. The most important Z sigils and their stats will be listed here:</p>

<p>Wait Time: Up to 17, reduces base cooldown (120 seconds) by the listed number</p>

<p>Duration: Up to 12, increases the base duration (15 seconds) by the listed number</p>

<p>(for Z Atk) Attack: Up to 15, gives 20*Attack+30 raw during uptime (up to 330)</p>

<p>(for Z Ele) Element: Up to 15, gives 0.1*Element+1.3 multiplier during uptime (up to 2.8)</p>

<p>Knowing this, how do we calculate how effective our sigil is during a full run? The base formula for full uptime is very simple: if your run doesn't end during an uptime, the base formula to calculate the effective raw of a Z Atk sigil is:</p>

<p>where is the amount of times you got a proc during a run, is the sigil effect (raw or ele multiplier), is the total duration of the sigil and is the total time that you were fighting the monster. An easy example: let's assume you finish a run of Zinogre with a Z-sigil in 4:32 (basically Hunters run), you get 2 sigil uptimes during the run and the total fight time is around 4:05-4:10 (since we enter the area later). Using means that the sigil provided an effective raw of 72.73, meaning ~27 raw more than a perfect 45 raw sigil. The effectivity of the sigil varies but is generally the highest when the run ends close to the time the last sigil duration ends. For longer runs (between 4 and 10 minutes) it generally averages to between 72 and 78 effective raw depending on how the uptimes are distributed. This means that Z Atk, provided that you get a high uptime of damage during the sigil procs, provides a slight advantage over the course of the fight. The Z Ele sigil however is way more interesting: it is insanely good on weapons like LS and SnS provided how good they scale with element, but both those weapons don't have what Swaxe has: an additional multiplier. Elemental Phials provide a 1.3x Ele boost on every attack that you do. This multiplier scales multiplicatively with transcend and the Z Ele sigil. This means (disregarding every other ele multiplier for now), with transcend, Z Ele sigil and Elemental phials together you get a total multiplier of around 7.5 for your element on every attack, which is absurd. During its uptime it is way stronger than Z Atk for Ele heavy matchups. The total effectivity is calculated similarly, by replacing the 330 raw by the multiplier of a perfect Z Ele sigil.</p>

<p>As a small appendix I wanna also include the calculation where the Z sigil is still active when the monster dies. This doesn't usually happen in most runs because it is inefficient but it's important to point out:</p>

<p>where is the percent duration that the sigil was active before the monster died. This means for example, if the last sigil was active for 13.5 seconds before the monster died, would be 0.5.</p>

<p>Something additional that needs to be mentioned is that the effectiveness of the sigil is also brought down by the amount of time needed to activate it and the resulting damage loss because of sacrificing potential hits during the activation time. This is especially apparent for narga, where the sigil activation time takes only slightly less time than a full upswing, downswing fadeslash combo.</p>

<!-- Elemental vs Power Phials Section -->
<section id="phial-comparison">
<h2>Ele phials vs. Power phials</h2>

<p>Yes, in some matchups (namely Boga, Zeru and Deviljhos) elemental phials are not only able to compete with power phials, they are straight up better! There are a few reasons for that:
First of all, aside from the different phial effects both Flash and Shine have the same raw, but Shine has more element! Combine this with the 1.3x Ele Boost of elemental phials, the 1.2x Ele Boost from elemental attack fruits and Furious, the 1.1x Ele Boost from all ele drug, the 2x Ele Boost from transcend (which you can use in many of these matchups!) and the 2.8x Ele Boost during sigil uptime of a perfect Z ele sigil, and you get mind blowingly large elemental numbers up to 18k for a lvl 100 Shine evo with combined uptimes and appropriate set/sigils.
The Second reason is that Swaxe gets 15 additional elemental HZV from dissolver, which is the highest tied with weapons like MS etc. This is not the case for all weapons (like Tonfas which only get 5) so this is another important point to note.</p>

<p>Here is a damage comparison for the best matchup for Ele Phials, Musou Boga:</p>

<p>We will do a comparison for power phials vs ele phials without an active Z sigil, one where for power phials we have Z Atk sigil active and for ele phials we have Z Ele sigil active, and one where the Z sigils are active and transcend is activated. We will take Boga's destroyed arm as a reference with every active buff that increases its HZV (pointbreak + thunder clad + deter). For the power phial calculation we will assume an average raw from shiri of around 50 (which is not accurate but this shouldn't matter) Let's start with power phials without Z sigil (normal Atk sigils with a SAF up sigil):</p>

This is a difference that power phials cannot make up, even if the Stylish Up damage is slightly higher (40 for normal Atk sigils, 45 during Z Atk uptime, 38 with ele sigils).

      <span class="c11">What is the strength of Obscurity Up</span>
      <span class="c18 c11">?</span>
    </h2>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c9">Alot of old Swaxe builds that were optimized for Musou hunts (especially the CS ones) used </span>
      <span class="c19 c9">only</span>
      <span class="c9">&nbsp;Stylish for sharpness recovery. It recovers 5 units of sharpness every time you iframe an attack which is more than enough to keep up the sharpness over an entire hunt without any issue. Problem is: without its Zenith Up skill, </span>
      <span class="c19 c9">Stylish doesn&rsquo;t provide any damage, while Obscurity Up does.</span>
      <span class="c9">&nbsp;</span>
      <span class="c9">Before getting into what Obscurity Up does, let&rsquo;s see what Obscurity itself does. Obscurity gives you raw damage which stacks up every time you parry. It stacks up to 225 raw for Swaxe after 10 parries total (+30 raw per parry on first 5 parries, +15 raw per parry on the last 5). You lose all of the raw once you get </span>
      <span class="c19 c9">knocked down by a monster</span>
      <span class="c0">. What Obscurity Up does is it reduces the total parry requirement for the max raw buff from 10 to 6 (+50 raw per parry on first 3 parries, +25 per parry on the last 3) and PD procs will now act like 3 parries towards the build up. After reaching the maximum amount of parries, each parry recovers 4 units of sharpness (10 if it is a PD). The sharpness recovery after a PD is visualized by a blue aura appearing every time you PD an attack. From this alone it is not hard to see why Obscurity Up is so much better than Stylish: you get a way faster Obscurity build up while maintaining sharpness nearly the same way. Of course in some cases you can potentially drop to purple using CS and Obscurity Up if you are fighting for a long time with only few parries (generally only in speedruns) but besides that you should generally have no sharpness problem.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8 c10">
      <span class="c0"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">Another advantage of gaining Obscurity quickly with Obscurity Up is that you can start stacking Stylish Assault earlier, which means you get a faster damage spike at the start of the run. Since you can drop sharpness near the end of CS runs if you&rsquo;re not fast enough, you can alternatively also run Stylish Up builds.</span>

      <span class="c5">Ceaseless Up</span>
      <span class="c0">. What Ceaseless Up does is it adds a 3rd stage to the Ceaseless skill which on top of what Ceaseless already provides gives +0.05 additional crit damage multiplier and 10% affinity (you can completely ignore the affinity and concentrate on the crit damage since with the scaling of crit con 10% affinity provides around 2 true raw). To give context to what these numbers mean here a following itemization of crit multipliers in this game:</span>

If the motion value ends up having a decimal, it will always get rounded down to the lower value (meaning even in a case of for example 50.9 MV the actual MV would get rounded down to 50).

    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c9">Comparing both tables, we can see that in the case of adding Ceaseless Up, we get an average damage increase of ~4.1 damage averaged over every move on the table (values run from 3 to 7 but most are in the range between 4 and 6). </span>
      <span class="c19 c9">It is very important to note that the Upslash and S Evasion Upslash (and it&rsquo;s charged counterpart), one of Swaxes highest DPS tools, gets rounded down from 93.6 to 93 (154.8 to 154 for the charged one).</span>
      <span class="c0">&nbsp;The effectiveness of Ceaseless Up depends on the decimal of the MV at both stage 2 and stage 3. The damage increase on the Vertical Slash for example gets increased from 87.5 to 90, which is a 3.45% increase in damage (after rounding) while the S Evasion Upslash gets an increase from 91 to 93.6, which is an increase of just 2.16% (after rounding).</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c9">If we take the average damage increase and compare it to increasing weapon raw by an arbitrary amount, we would roughly get a similar increase when going from </span>
      <span class="c5">770 to 830 (meaning 60 extra true raw, in reality it&rsquo;s less because of the upslash damage loss)</span>
      <span class="c9">, which can at least give us a rough estimate of its strength for a non-CS set on one of its usual matchups. This is of course not definite and things </span>
      <span class="c19 c9">could</span>
      <span class="c9">&nbsp;change depending on what skills you run on a set. Now it is important to note that this assumes 100% uptime of the skill, but to activate it in the first place we need a combination of </span>
      <span class="c5">17 slashes/reflects/stylish up procs</span>
      <span class="c0">&nbsp;(from stage 2 to stage 3) and lasts for 12 seconds before falling back to the second stage after not landing more slashes/reflects/Stylish Up procs. For Swaxe specifically the time needed to activate stage 3 of Ceaseless isn&rsquo;t that long (especially in reflect matchups).</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8 c10">
      <span class="c0"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">If you were to drop SW+2 (for example for Durem) the base crit multiplier would be 1.65, which would get raised to 1.7 with Ceaseless Up. This means that Upslash and Vertical Slash get an MV increase of 3 instead of Upslash having 2 like before and the charged Upslash gets an MV increase of 5 instead of 4. In this case Ceaseless Up provides a higher percentage damage increase overall compared to the SW+2 case.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8 c10">
      <span class="c0"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">Another important point to touch on is that Ceaseless Up also lowers the required amount of hits to reach stage 1 and stage 2 respectively. Why I haven&rsquo;t greatly mentioned this is because for switch axe specifically this doesn&rsquo;t have a large effect since switch axe is a fairly fast hitting weapon. It&rsquo;s still important to talk about since it gains us some points of true raw but not as many as for example for slow hitting weapons like gs, hammer, ms etc. </span>

    </h2>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c9">Here is where it gets interesting. This discussion will mainly include </span>
      <span class="c5">Elz </span>
      <span class="c9">as a reference monster, but what is said here also works for </span>
      <span class="c5">Zino</span>
      <span class="c9">. What is important to note about Elzelion is a very interesting mechanic: for every projectile move that Elzelion does (Icicle/Fireball throw), </span>
      <span class="c19 c9">if you PD and fade slash immediately afterwards, you will proc Stylish/Stylish Assault on the fade slash.</span>
      <span class="c9">&nbsp;This is very important and I&rsquo;ll show you why in the following comparison: Reflect+3 and Reflect Up raise the MV of a PD from 72 to 92, while Stylish Up provides a motion value of 30 when you iframe an attack, meaning that in the case of Elz&rsquo;s projectiles, you would have a combined mv of 72+30=102. Now since you also want to account for keeping your stylish assault up on top of that, you would get damage in where you purely iframe attacks (which has to happen within a 20s window) and lose a bit of damage on regular pd&rsquo;s. For this fight it can be said that </span>
      <span class="c19 c9">both Stylish+Up and Reflect+Up provide good value for Elz specifically</span>
      <span class="c0">&nbsp;but the latter doesn&rsquo;t punish you as hard for not PDing constantly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8 c10">
      <span class="c0"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c9">An interesting talking point would also be running Stylish+Stylish up for cs sets instead of Obscurity Up+Ceaseless Up (or Ice Age). The net damage gain from this skill increases the more you iframe attacks (meaning stylish up has high value against monsters with a high attack frequency like narga or zino) but it does less damage the slower the monster is (e.g. boga/zeru). </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8 c10">
      <span class="c6 c5"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c9">Another interesting talking point is pairing stylish up with consumption slayer instead of Ceaseless Up and sharpen with a perfect whetstone mid-fight. This works very well for Zino/Elz during the phase transition and after depleting the crystals you can keep up the sharpness very well with stylish up. The advantage of consumption slayer instead of Ceaseless up is that it also increases PD and stylish up damage. </span>
      <span class="c19 c9">In a run with optimal RNG this can give a non-negligible boost of damage</span>
      <span class="c0">&nbsp;(~40-50 more raw if we compare with effective raw+more pd/stylish up damage).</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8 c10">
      <span class="c0"></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c0">A very interesting combination of skills is also bringing both Stylish+Up and Reflect+Up instead of Ceaseless Up/Obscurity Up and Ice Age. This works wonders against both of the example cases (Elz and Zino) because you get the consistent 20 motion value PD increase of Reflect Up and can pair this with the 30 motion value from Stylish Up on alot of Elzes attacks. Not having a perfect PD rate will also net you more damage with this build than the normal stylish up build since it still provides 68 motion value on a normal parry instead of none. It seems this could be the most consistent and highest damage combination for Elz.</span>

      <span class="c0">Ice age is generally run on nearly every set apart from very few specific cases but it&rsquo;s important to discuss its effectiveness during a hunt.

      <span class="c9">Now what becomes pretty clear is that ice age does less damage the lower the defense rate of the monster is (as can be seen in the formula), </span>
      <span class="c5">however something important to note is that ice age ignores hitzones aswell</span>
      <span class="c0">. This makes this skill a good candidate for consistent damage on a monster with bad hitzones (e.g. Zino) and a rather replaceable skill for a monster with alot of EHP and very good hitzones (e.g. Boga). Another sad part about the skill is also that it only scales with weapon/sigil/sr true raw and not with additional gained raw throughout the fight. For a fast Elz run of ~8 minutes of fighting (30 seconds of preparation) the total damage of ice age dealt throughout this fight would be 480x4=1920 which is 6.4% of his HP as &ldquo;free damage&rdquo;. You reach a similar number vs Zino over half the fight time (5.6%) just by the difference of their defense rate and since Boga for example is a monster with tons of EHP which still dies comparatively fast (~5:10 of fighting), it only deals around 3% to his THP over the course of the fight, the conclusions to draw from this should be obvious.</span>

      <span class="c9">When it comes to dropping the skill, the noteworthy mentions would be cs+reflect sets that also run stylish assault (for elz e.g.) but these are very niche cases because most endgame sets for Swaxe already contain alot of the best damage skills in the game. </span>
      <span class="c21 c19 c9">This means that you want to usually include ice age as a free damage component in your sets.</span>

    </h2>
    <p class="c8">
      <span class="c9">Elemental Attack Up is an interesting skill in that it provides a very simple buff to element (additional 1.1 multiplier) but has a snowball effect when combined with every other elemental multiplier in the game and ends up being a very significant damage increase with every uptime. It is essential for every Ele Phial matchup and essentially replaces Ice Age because of its overall higher damage increase. In contrast to this you never really want to take it outside of Ele Phial matchups because for Power Phials (especially against monsters with a low defense rate) the percentage damage increase for element is very much negligible. </span>

      <span class="c9">Extreme Style Lightsword Mode has a static cap of 300 &ldquo;Phial Units&rdquo;. At the start of a quest or when you revive after fainting you will always have 150 Phial Units. Parries restore 75 units or 150 during active feature. Edge Marshal reduces Phial Unit costs to 0.75x or a 25% reduction to all attacks that spend Phials.

      <span class="c9">The method used to arrive at these numbers assumes that the values from Wycademy are true. The first test performed was without Tech. After getting full phials (2 parries w/ no active) I stood in base camp and performed Vertical Slashes/Upwards Slashes (both 10 phial usage according to Wycademy) until the phial meter was empty. This required 30 swings in total (30x10 = 300 hence the 300 maximum phial units and 150 starting phial units). The second test was the exact same but with Tech and required 38 swings from full to reach empty. 38 divided by 30 = 1.267 which I round down to 25% for convenience sake.</span>
