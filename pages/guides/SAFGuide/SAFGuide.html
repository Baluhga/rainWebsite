                    This document is intended for anyone that is starting to play Switch Axe F, or already plays it
                    and seeks more information on matchups/builds. This document has SAF specific information
                    and sets for every part of progression from your first moments in G rank and getting your first
                    Switch Axe all the way up to slaying Zeniths and even Musous.

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    The Switch Axe Frontier or SAF (in the rest of the document referred to as Swaxe) is a parry
                    heavy weapon. This weapon has multiple valid playstyles, a fairly low skill floor but also one of
                    the higher skill ceilings as far as Frontier weapons go. It relies heavily on both its ability to block
                    but also its fade slash, which is an offensive move that gives you invincibility frames (i-frames)
                    and generally allows for a very aggressive playstyle.
                </p>

            <!-- Style/Controls Section -->
            <section id="style">
                <h1>Style/Controls/Swaxe Specifics</h1>
                <p>
                    Extreme Style is a combo of Heaven/Storm and is strictly better than the other options for
                    every situation. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3kigaECrLg">SephVII</a> has a great video tutorial covering the basic controls of the weapon.
                </p>

                <h2>Lightsword Main Damage Combo</h2>
                <p>
                    Overhead/Downslash (Primary atk button Y/Triangle) → Fade Slash (Both atk buttons and either backwards or sideways movement Y/Triangle + B/Circle + Left/Right/Back left stick) → Forward Slash (Primary atk button Y/Triangle + Forward left stick) → Repeat
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fit parries in as needed and fade slash after for maximum dps. Remember you can use
                    standing slashes after a successful parry (primary atk button Y/Triangle) and charged slashes
                    after a fade slash (Hold primary atk button Y/Triangle, hold left stick forward for a faster
                    version that moves you forward) to delay your attacks or for extra range.
                </p>

                <h2>Phial Types</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Element:</strong> 1.3x Ele Boost, good for specific matchups</li>
                    <li><strong>Power:</strong> 1.1x Raw Boost, good for general use</li>
                    <li><strong>Status:</strong> 1.3x Status Boost, situationally useful</li>
                    <li><strong>Stun:</strong> Adds KO buildup to attacks that spend phials, mainly for road</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <!-- Sigils Section -->
            <section id="sigils">
                <h1>Sigils</h1>
                <p>
                    Sigils can only be placed on your weapon and take up decoration slots. Swaxe benefits a lot
                    from sigils compared to some other weapons and the ones you use will largely depend on your
                    phial type and the situation.
                </p>
                <p>Short form for Attack will be Atk as well as Ele for Element (for sigils only).</p>

                <h2>Most important Sigils</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SAF Up Atk Atk:</strong> Standard sigil on every non-ele phial switch axe</li>
                    <li><strong>Atk Atk Atk:</strong> Standard sigil on every non-ele phial switch axe</li>
                    <li><strong>SAF Up Ele Ele:</strong> Use with Element Phials</li>
                    <li><strong>Ele Ele Ele:</strong> Use with Element Phials</li>
                    <li><strong>SAF Up (SAF) Guard Atk/Ele:</strong> Increases the angle at which you can parry and heals for 15HP on every successful block, very comfy for a lot of matchups</li>
                    <li><strong>SAF Up (SAF) Stun. B Atk:</strong> Used for road, improves discharge stun values</li>
                    <li><strong>Stun Value Atk Atk:</strong> Used with KO phials on Road, improves all KO values</li>
                    <li><strong>Wait Time Duration Atk/Ele:</strong> Perfect sigils of this kind are better than their all Attack/Element counterparts, getting them is the hard part.</li>
                </ul>

            <!-- What Swaxe do I make Section -->
            <section id="what-swaxe">
                <h1>What Swaxe do I make?</h1>
                <p>Here will be presented a visual guide for which Swaxes to make at which point in the game.</p>

                <h2>G Rank Swaxes</h2>
                
                <p>G Rank only has a few Swaxes worth making.</p>

                <h3>GR1+ (Steel Crushing Axe)</h3>
                <img src="images/image28.png" class="full-width-img" alt="G Rank Progression">
                <img src="images/image27.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Steel Crushing Axe stats">
                <p>
                    The earliest you unlock the Swaxe will be once you enter G-rank. So once you've got that done
                    you should go into making the Orb Swaxe by completing the "Anti-Kushala Daora Weaponry"
                    quest in the "Gear Acquisition" section at the G rank quest counter. 10 orbs are required for the swaxe.
                </p>

                <h3>GR1+ (B.Zero Dragon Axe)</h3>
                <img src="images/image18.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Steel Crushing Axe">
                <img src="images/image39.png" class="full-width-img" alt="B.Zero Dragon Axe stats">
                <p>
                    You can make this Swaxe as soon as you enter G rank by spending NP to buy all the parts.
                    Either get to GR150 and grind Elze for this Swaxe or you can use a mixture of
                    GCP/RDP/NP to buy all the parts. This Swaxe is generally the last G Swaxe you will make before
                    you start using zenith weapons.
                </p>

                <h3>(Optional) Diva Weapons (Torag - Canso/Serisui - Canso)</h3>
                <img src="images/image45.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Diva Weapon stats">
                <img src="images/image21.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Diva Weapon">

                <p>
                    Diva weapons are the strongest G rank weapons but they require a lot of grinding. You
                    will be able to equip Zenith gear before you fully upgrade one. They are mentioned here
                    because they are generally best in slot for bounties that restrict you to only G gear. The
                    red one (pictured) is usually better but if you prefer the blue or like having lots of options
                    feel free to get both.
                </p>

                <h2>Early Zenith Swaxes</h2>
                <p>These Swaxes are great options for people looking to make their first Z weapon or for bounties that ban Evos and Fransisca.</p>

                <h3>Baru Swaxe</h3>
                <img src="images/image19.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Early Zenith progression">
                <img src="images/image11.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Baru Swaxe stats">
                <p>
                    This Swaxe is really good as a first one after unlocking zeniths. Has power phials, decent
                    water element, good raw and above all else Skill Slots Up+1 which makes set-building
                    easier. Very good all-arounder.
                </p>

                <h3>Gravios Swaxe</h3>
                <img src="images/image10.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Gravios Swaxe">
                <img src="images/image43.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Gravios Swaxe stats">
                <p>
                    The Gravios Swaxe has really good stats all around. High raw, high element, and a
                    decent amount of blast. It also has Vigorous Up and stun phials which are great in road.
                </p>

                <h3>Gasura Swaxe</h3>
                <img src="images/image7.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Gasura Swaxe">
                <img src="images/image35.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Gasura Swaxe stats">
                <p>
                    Gasura Swaxe is a bit different than the former option. It's not considered general use because
                    there are quite a few poison resistant zeniths in this game (baru, gasura, espinas), but it's
                    definitely still really good. It has good raw, decent poison, very good sharpness and
                    Obscurity Up zenith skill which you usually run on Swaxe anyway. Status phials are not the
                    best but the high raw compared to baru alleviates this a bit.
                </p>

                <h2>Festi Swaxes</h2>
                <p>To make these Swaxes you will need to unlock "Festi Gems" in the road shop by reaching floor 21 or higher in a single run.</p>

                <h3>Poet Swaxe</h3>
                <img src="images/image13.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Poet Swaxe">
                <img src="images/image5.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Poet Swaxe stats">
                <p>
                    This Swaxe features a good combo element (100% Ice/100%Water) and ele phials along
                    with SSU as the Z skill. It's good against monsters that are weak to either ice or
                    water and excellent against monsters that are weak to both (Z Mido/Boga/Taikun etc).
                </p>

                <h3>Chroma Swaxe</h3>
                <img src="images/image29.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Poet Swaxe additional">
                <img src="images/image20.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Chroma Swaxe stats">
                <p>
                    This Swaxe is great against monsters that are weak to dragon damage (B.Flame is
                    150% Dragon/50%Fire). Dragon tends to be a less common weakness for Zeniths
                    and damage-wise this Swaxe is outclassed by Ravi "Shine" but it's useful for breaking
                    Z Torid wings (Which are needed for the "Flash" evo weapons).
                </p>

                <h3>Ruber-Tsukuri</h3>
                <img src="images/image14.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Ruber-Tsukuri">
                <img src="images/image12.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Ruber-Tsukuri stats">
                <p>
                    Similar to the Chroma but with slightly worse stats and a reversed combo element
                    (150%Fire/50%Dragon). This weapon gets outclassed by Fransisca but is much easier
                    and cheaper to make and may even be preferred in matchups like Giaorugu where
                    the head is not the Z part.
                </p>

                <h2>Mid-Late game options</h2>
                <p>
                    These Swaxes are great but require some investment and aren't as easily obtainable as
                    some of the earlier ones mentioned. They are still cheaper/easier to get than an EVO weapon.
                </p>

                <h3>Supreme Axe Francisca</h3>
                <img src="images/image33.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Mid-Late game progression">
                <img src="images/image23.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Supreme Axe Francisca stats">
                <p>
                    Francisca has stun phials, Skill Slots Up+1 a good amount of raw, paralysis and
                    especially light element (70% Fire/ 70% Thunder). It works wonders for Zenith
                    farming, especially when the weak spot of the monster is the head meaning you get a
                    free stun in your hunt.
                </p>

                <h3>Happy Meowoween</h3>
                <img src="images/image16.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Happy Meowoween">
                <img src="images/image25.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Happy Meowoween stats">
                <p>
                    This switch axe has status phials, Skill Slots Up+1, poison and a lot of cyan sharpness. While
                    status phials aren't that great, the other weapon stats are amazing and poison is a
                    strong status in this game.
                </p>

                <h3>Tower Swaxe (Blue Blood)</h3>
                <img src="images/image46.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Tower Swaxe">
                <img src="images/image26.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Tower Swaxe stats">
                <p>
                    Highly customizable endgame weapon that's very cheap to make and does its job
                    extremely well. The simulation of the stats is listed in the picture on the right. You want
                    to pair this weapon with Abnormality. You lose Z partbreaker and normal weapon
                    sigils but gain quite a lot of raw and element combined with poison in return.

                <h2>Ravi Evolution Swaxes</h2>
                <p>These weapons require a lot of grinding to fully upgrade but are extremely powerful. Ravi weapons are obtainable without any Bounty Coins.</p>

                <h3>Ravi "Flash"</h3>
                <img src="images/image30.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Ravi Evolution progression">
                <img src="images/image3.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Ravi Flash stats">
                <p>
                    Ravi Flash is a very good evo to start off with when you don't have enough funds to
                    be able to afford a premium evo (highly depends on the server you play on, on
                    rain premium evos cost BC). 1000 Dragon, 30% affinity, 150 hits of cyan sharpness
                    and SSU+1 are very solid stats and make it a really good endgame Swaxe. Very
                    good for Zeru and Durem specifically.
                </p>

                <h3>Ravi "Shine"</h3>
                <img src="images/image9.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Ravi Shine">
                <img src="images/image22.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Ravi Shine stats">
                <p>
                    With 2800 Dragon it has the highest element next to other "Shine" evos, and
                    has the ele phial 1.3x ele multiplier on top of that. It is especially good against Zeru,
                    and when paired with a perfect Z Element Sigil. Outside of Zeru it's use cases are
                    rather niche and mostly good for very dragon weak monsters.
                </p>

                <h3>Ravi "Clear"</h3>
                <img src="images/image44.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Ravi Clear">
                <img src="images/image38.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Ravi Clear stats">
                <p>
                    This Swaxe has the highest base true raw of all the evos, 100% natural affinity and
                    KO Phials. These traits make it an excellent choice for road.
                </p>

                <h2>Premium Evolution Swaxes</h2>
                <p>These weapons upgrade the same way as Ravi weapons but they also require bounty coins to purchase.</p>

                <h3>Despair Frostaxe</h3>
                <img src="images/image2.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Despair Frostaxe">
                <img src="images/image37.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Despair Frostaxe Flash stats">
                <img src="images/image15.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Despair Frostaxe Shine stats">
                <p>
                    This is the best general use endgame Swaxe in the game. It can have either power phials
                    (Flash) or ele phials (Shine), has SSU+1, quite a lot of ice and 150 hits of cyan sharpness. Since
                    a lot of the endgame monsters are weak to ice, it's a general beast and even if not it can kill the
                    monster with ease. Make this first if you have the funds to do so.
                </p>

                <h3>Despair Boltaxe</h3>
                <img src="images/image40.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Despair Boltaxe">
                <img src="images/image41.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Black Flowaxt progression">
                <img src="images/image1.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Black Flowaxt">
                <p>
                    Thunder variant premium evo. Especially useful for grinding Narga or other thunder weak monsters,
                    but not a huge priority.
                </p>

                <h3>Black Flowaxt</h3>
          
                <img src="images/image34.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Black Flowaxt weapon">

                <p>
                    Water variant premium evo. Very niche use cases like Disu, but looks pretty cool. Make this
                    as one of the later ones.
                </p>

                <h3>Black Charaxt</h3>
                <img src="images/image42.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Black Charaxt">
                <img src="images/image4.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Black Charaxt Flash stats">
                <img src="images/image8.png" class="full-width-img" alt="Black Charaxt Shine stats">
                <p>
                    Fire variant premium evo. For endgame monsters practically never used but very
                    awesome for zeniths since a lot of zeniths are weak to fire. If you plan to do advanced road
                    runs with a no stunlock group this Swaxe is fantastic.
